# Tableau
In the "Tableau Snapbikes Trip Analysis" project, the goal is to analyze bike trip data to uncover key insights and trends using Tableau as the primary tool for visualization.

The analysis addresses the following problem areas:

Most Popular Start and End Stations: The data will be explored to identify which stations see the highest number of trip starts and ends, providing insights into the most frequented locations by riders.

Average Trip Duration by Gender: By filtering the trip data based on gender, the average duration of rides will be calculated and analyzed to detect any trends or differences between gender groups.

Distribution of Common End Stations at Popular Start Stations: The relationship between frequently used start stations and their corresponding end stations will be examined, identifying which routes are most common among riders.

Trip Start and End Distribution by Hour: This analysis focuses on the time-of-day patterns, showing how the number of trips starting and ending fluctuates across different hours of the day, helping to identify peak usage times.

These insights will help provide a deeper understanding of user behavior and station utilization in the Snapbikes system.
